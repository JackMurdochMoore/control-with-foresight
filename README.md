__This code__ should allow reproduction of Fig. 2-3 of the paper via the following steps.
1. To generate the data, run the script _gen_data_comparison_ with "comparisonType = 1" and "comparisonType = 2" in lines 11-12 of the script.
    * This will produce the .MAT files of data _comparison-1e-06,0.001,0.1,1_bist_cont-3,5_strat-43,43,43,43_energy-1,1,1,1.mat_ and _comparison-0.0001,0.0001,0.0001_bist_cont-3,4_strat-45,46,43_energy-100000,1,1.mat_.
2. Run _plot_relaxation_comparison_ and _plot_strategy_comparison_ to use the .MAT files to produce the image files _comparison-1e-06,0.001,0.1,1_bist_cont-3,5_strat-43,43,43,43.png_ (Fig. 3 of paper) and _comparison-0.0001,0.0001,0.0001_bist_cont-3,4_strat-45,46,43.png_ (Fig. 2 of paper).

__Functions and scripts:__
* _gen_data_comparison.m:_ Script which defines dynamical system, finds its fixed points and runs function _control_func.m_ to implement control.
* _control_func.m:_ Function which implements different control strategies.
* _plot_strategy_comparison.m:_ Script which uses data _comparison-0.0001,0.0001,0.0001_bist_cont-3,4_strat-45,46,43_energy-100000,1,1.mat_ to produce image _comparison-1e-06,0.001,0.1,1_bist_cont-3,5_strat-43,43,43,43.png_ (Fig. 3 of paper).
* _plot_relaxation_comparison.m:_ Script which uses data _comparison-0.0001,0.0001,0.0001_bist_cont-3,4_strat-45,46,43_energy-100000,1,1.mat_ to produce image _comparison-0.0001,0.0001,0.0001_bist_cont-3,4_strat-45,46,43_energy-100000,1,1.mat_ (Fig. 2 of paper).
* _vector_to_string.m:_ A function to turn a vector into a string format which is convenient useful for saving files with informative names.
* _make_inset.m:_ A function used to make insets in the images _comparison-1e-06,0.001,0.1,1_bist_cont-3,5_strat-43,43,43,43.png_ (Fig. 3 of paper) and _comparison-0.0001,0.0001,0.0001_bist_cont-3,4_strat-45,46,43.png_ (Fig. 2 of paper).

__Data and images:__
* _comparison-0.0001,0.0001,0.0001_bist_cont-3,4_strat-45,46,43_energy-100000,1,1.mat:_ Data, produced by script _gen_data_comparison.m_ via function _control_func.m_, which allows comparison of different control strategies.
* _comparison-1e-06,0.001,0.1,1_bist_cont-3,5_strat-43,43,43,43_energy-1,1,1,1.mat:_ Data, produced by script _gen_data_comparison.m_ via function _control_func.m_, which allows comparison of different values of the relaxation parameter r.
* _comparison-0.0001,0.0001,0.0001_bist_cont-3,4_strat-45,46,43.png:_ Image, produced by script _plot_strategy_comparison.m_ using data _comparison-0.0001,0.0001,0.0001_bist_cont-3,4_strat-45,46,43_energy-100000,1,1.mat_, which juxtaposes outcomes of different control strategies.
* _comparison-1e-06,0.001,0.1,1_bist_cont-3,5_strat-43,43,43,43.png:_ Image, produced by script _plot_relaxation_comparison.m_ using data _comparison-1e-06,0.001,0.1,1_bist_cont-3,5_strat-43,43,43,43_energy-1,1,1,1.mat_, which juxtaposes outcomes of different values of the relaxation parameter r.
