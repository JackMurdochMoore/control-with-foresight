__About__\
\* This code should allow reproduction of Fig. 2-3 of the paper. To generate the data, run the script "gen_data_comparison" with the appropriate options.
\* The code some unnecessary parts

_log_like_4.m:_ Calculate log-likelihood per observation for model C(s) = s^D.\
_plot_corr_dim_estimates.m:_ Plot results of benchmarking, previously saved in folders "results-est-dim-3" and "results-est-dim-4".\
_show_fit_func.m:_ Fit power-law to an interval and illustrate fit and objective function (negative log-likelihood per observation).\
_show_fit_script.m:_ Illustrate fit and fitting process for empirical or synthetic networks by calling function show_fit_func.m.\
_small_world_manhattan.m:_ Generate lattice* or small world network*.\
_small_world_manhattan_lcc.m:_ Generate lattice* or small world network* and retain only its largest connected component.

\* Lattices/small world networks are/are derived from regular $D$-dimensional toroidal lattices defined using a periodic version of the city block (or Manhattan or taxi cab) metric mentioned but not explored in "Epidemic dynamics on higher-dimensional small world networks", _Applied Mathematics and Computation_
